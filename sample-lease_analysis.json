In a commercial context, demonstrated property damages could reach several thousand dollars, and if 93A applies, double or triple damages could be awarded.

If the landlord consistently rejects qualified applicants without a valid reason, it could be considered a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The analysis above assumes this is for a residential lease, as the laws cited apply to residential property. The analysis needs to be re-evaluated if this is for a commercial lease.",
      "recommendation": "Confirm whether the lease is for residential or commercial purposes. If it's commercial, the analysis and potential violations will change significantly."

      "issue": "The insurance requirements placed on the tenant (specifically regarding contractor's insurance in Section 10.1(d)) seem onerous, especially if this is a small business tenant. The tenant should verify their ability to obtain and afford such coverage.",

      "issue": "The lease mentions holding over and tenancy at sufferance, but it lacks details about how rent is calculated during a holdover period. Landlords in MA often substantially increase the rent during the holdover period.",
      "recommendation": "The lease should specify the rent amount or method for calculating the rent during the holdover period to protect the tenant from exorbitant increases."

In a commercial context, demonstrated property damages could reach several thousand dollars, and if 93A applies, double or triple damages could be awarded.
