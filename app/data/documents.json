Tenant shall, during the term hereof, assume and maintain exclusive control of the Premises and defend, indemn ify and save harmless Landlord from and against all claims, expenses or liability of whatever nature arising from any act, omission or negligence of Tenant, Tenant's contractors, agents, employees, customers, and invitees, or anyone claiming by, through or  under Tenant, or arising, directly or indirectly, from any accident, injury or damage whatsoever, however caused, to any person, or to the property of any person, occurring after Tenant enters the Premises for any reason and until the end of the term of t his Lease and, thereafter, so long as Tenant or any occupant claiming under Tenant is in occupancy of any part of the Premises, in or about the Premises, or arising from any accident occurring outside the Premises but within the general area of the Premise s, where such accident, injury or damage results or is claimed to have resulted from any act, omission or negligence on the part of Tenant or Tenant's contractors, agents, employees, customers, and invitees, or anyone claiming by, through or under Tenant.",

          "explanation": "This clause requires the tenant to indemnify the landlord for *any* liability, regardless of whether the landlord's negligence caused the injury, loss, or damage. This is a broad indemnification clause that violates M.G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 15, which prohibits lease provisions that indemnify the landlord from their own negligence. This clause attempts to exonerate the landlord from liability for their own misconduct, which is against public policy.",

          "recovery_calculation": "Violation of Chapter 186, Section 15 renders the clause void. If the tenant incurs expenses or liability due to this clause being enforced, they can recover actual damages. Given the breadth of the indemnification (any liability, any cause), a reasonable estimate of potential legal fees, medical bills, or property damage for a single incident could easily reach $5,000 - $10,000. If the landlord attempts to enforce this clause knowing it is illegal, Chapter 93A could apply, potentially doubling or tripling the damages and adding attorney's fees."

To the maximum extent this Lease may be made effective according to law, Tenant agrees to use and occupy the Premis es at Tenant's own risk, and Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss or damage to fixtures or other personal property of Tenant or any person claiming by, through or under Tenant.  Without limitation, Tenant agrees that Landlord sha ll not be responsible or liable to Tenant, or those claiming by, through or under Tenant, for any loss or damage resulting to Tenant or those claiming by, through or under Tenant, its or their property from the breaking, bursting, stopping or leaking of el ectric cables and wires, and water, gas or steam pipes.",
          "violation": "Chapter 186, Section 15",

M.G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 15 explicitly prohibits such clauses in residential leases, deeming them against public policy and void. The phrase 'to the maximum extent this Lease may be made effective according to law' is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the law.",

If the tenant suffers property damage due to the landlord's negligence (e.g., a leaky pipe the landlord failed to repair), the tenant can recover the cost of the damaged property. This could easily amount to several thousand dollars (e.g., damaged furniture, electronics). Furthermore, if the landlord attempts to enforce this illegal clause, the tenant could potentially pursue a Chapter 93A claim, leading to double or triple damages and attorney's fees. Estimated value based on average cost of property damage and potential for treble damages: (($2500 average damage)*3). "

          "explanation": "This clause attempts to absolve the landlord of any responsibility for hazardous substances on the property and any obligation to remediate them. This is highly problematic as it could violate the implied warranty of habitability, which requires landlords to provide safe and habitable living conditions. While a commercial lease may allocate the responsibilities for hazardous substance remediation, a residential lease cannot simply disclaim all responsibility and liability relating to tenant's health and safety. A presence of hazardous materials makes the premises uninhabitable. This may also violate Chapter 93A.",

Damages could include medical expenses, lost wages, relocation costs, and property damage. If a 93A violation is proven (unfair or deceptive act by including such a clause and failing to disclose hazardous material), damages could be doubled or tripled, plus attorney's fees. Estimate is based on potential relocation, medical, and legal costs: $5,000 actual x 3 with Chapter 93A violation = $15,000."

While the statute does not specify a damage amount, typical damages awarded in MA courts for similar violations, considering the potential for significant property damage or injury resulting from landlord negligence, range from $1,000 to $5,000, plus actual damages to the tenant's property or injury if applicable.

          "explanation": "This clause states the tenant is responsible for the landlord's attorney fees. Chapter 186, Section 20 implies a reciprocal covenant requiring the landlord to pay the tenant's attorney fees if the tenant prevails in a dispute. This clause is illegal because it only allows for landlord recovery of attorney fees but does not grant the same right to the tenant, therefore, it's a waiver of the tenant's rights if the landlord successfully sues the tenant. This is considered against public policy.",

This can range from $5,000 to $20,000 or more, depending on the complexity of the case. If the landlord violates Chapter 93A by attempting to enforce this illegal clause, the tenant may be entitled to double or triple damages, plus attorney's fees. The 'base' amount (single damages) would be the cost to defend the action. The total recovery depends on the actual damages, the number of times it is multiplied (either double or triple) and the legal costs."

While this might be more acceptable in a commercial lease, it raises concerns if the property is intended for any residential use. It could be problematic if the 'as is' condition includes code violations or conditions rendering the premises uninhabitable.",
          "explanation": "While commercial leases often contain 'as is' clauses, Massachusetts law requires landlords to maintain premises in habitable condition, ensure compliance with sanitary and building codes, and refrain from misrepresentations. This broad disclaimer could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent these obligations, especially if the permitted use allows for residential aspects.",

This is generally acceptable in a commercial lease, but could be considered a violation of Chapter 93A if applied to a tenant in a mixed-use or residential capacity without clear, prominent disclosure and justification.",
          "explanation": "While commercial leases can allocate tax burdens to tenants, residential leases cannot impose unforeseen and unreasonable tax burdens.

          "risk": "While it's standard for commercial tenants to pay utilities, if the premises are used for residential purposes, this clause could be problematic if it results in the landlord failing to maintain essential services.

          "risk": "This clause places a very broad responsibility on the tenant for maintenance. While generally acceptable for commercial leases, if there's a residential element, parts of it might be unenforceable. The specific language is broad, so there's the risk of a dispute about ordinary wear and tear. Especially requiring the tenant to keep 'all other areas of the building' in good condition could impose costs unrelated to tenant's use.",

The landlord could impose burdensome or costly requirements related to the tenant's work, even if the work itself is minor or reasonable.

The landlord's right to direct 'additional work' to achieve 'material conformity' could lead to costly and time-consuming disputes if the plans were not perfectly clear or if the landlord's expectations are unreasonable.

However, some of the clauses (e.g., maintenance, 'as is' condition) could create unintended risks if the property is used for mixed-use or residential purposes. The \"permitted uses\" section requires clear definition of the property to understand the full implications of the lease agreement.",
          "recommendation": "The 'Permitted Uses' section must be filled in specifically to clarify whether the lease can be used for residential purposes. Ensure the 'Request for Proposals' and Tenant's proposal clearly define the intended use to mitigate future disputes."

          "issue": "The lease places significant insurance requirements on the tenant, particularly regarding work performed on the premises. The tenant needs to carefully review these requirements and ensure they can comply, as failure to do so could result in a breach of the lease.",
          "recommendation": "The tenant should consult with an insurance professional to understand the coverage requirements and obtain appropriate policies. They should also carefully document all insurance policies and provide certificates to the landlord as required by the lease."
        },
        {
          "issue": "Several clauses involve indemnification and hold harmless agreements, which are complex and potentially risky. The tenant may not fully understand the extent of their obligations under these clauses.",

          "issue": "The lease places a significant burden on the tenant to obtain and maintain various types of insurance, including insurance for the landlord and their agents. The reasonableness and necessity of these requirements should be carefully evaluated.",
          "recommendation": "The tenant should review the insurance requirements with an insurance professional to determine if the coverage amounts are reasonable and necessary for their business or activity. They should also negotiate with the landlord to reduce the scope or amount of required insurance, particularly the requirements for contractors."

This is a potential area of concern. While a Landlord has insurance and it is possible they can collect, the Tenant would remain on the hook if their business is interrupted.",
          "recommendation": "The Tenant should consult their legal counsel regarding the ramifications of such a clause. The tenant should consider purchasing a policy for Business Interruption so the Landlord remains covered if there is any damage.

It requires the tenant to indemnify the landlord against *all* claims arising from *any* act, omission or negligence of the tenant or anyone related to the tenant, even if the landlord is also negligent. Massachusetts courts disfavor indemnification clauses that require a party to indemnify another for its own negligence, unless the clause is clear and unequivocal. This clause may not meet that standard, and a court could find it unenforceable if the landlord is partially at fault for the underlying claim.",
