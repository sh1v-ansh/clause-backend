[NAME_REDACTED] insured by reputable, duly licensed insurance companies against loss or d amage by fire with the 
usual extended coverage endorsements.  Within a reasonable time after [NAME_REDACTED] enters the [NAME_REDACTED]ses, no 
less often than annually thereafter, and at any other time upon the request of [NAME_REDACTED]dlord, [NAME_REDACTED] shall 
furnish to [NAME_REDACTED]dlord evidence o f such continuous insurance coverage satisfactory to [NAME_REDACTED]dlord.  It is 
understood and agreed that [NAME_REDACTED] assumes all risk of damage to its own property arising from any 
cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, loss by theft or otherwise.  
 
 10.3.  [ORG_REDACTED].  [NAME_REDACTED]dlord shall be named as an additional insured on all 
insurance policies.  All required insurance shall be written with such companies qualified to do business 
in Massachusetts, as [NAME_REDACTED] shall select and [NAME_REDACTED]dlord shall approve, which  approval [NAME_REDACTED]dlord agrees not 
to withhold unreasonably. Without limiting [NAME_REDACTED]dlord's other rights under any other provisions of this 
[NAME_REDACTED], if [NAME_REDACTED] shall fail to keep the [NAME_REDACTED]ses insured as provided herein, and if such failure shall 
continue to a period of ten (10) days following written notice by [NAME_REDACTED]dlord to [NAME_REDACTED] thereof, then 
[NAME_REDACTED]dlord, without further notice to [NAME_REDACTED], may take out and pay for such insurance, and the amount of 
such payment shall become due and payable as [ORG_REDACTED] on demand.  

 
 [NAME_REDACTED] hereby waives any and all rights of recovery which it might otherwise have against 
[NAME_REDACTED]dlord, its agents, employees and other persons for whom [NAME_REDACTED]dlord may be responsible for any loss 
or damage to [NAME_REDACTED] property or improvements in the [NAME_REDACTED]ses whi ch are either required to be 
insured under the terms of this [NAME_REDACTED] or which [NAME_REDACTED], in the absence of any such requirement, elects to 
insure, notwithstanding that the loss or damage may result from the negligence, willful act or default 
under the terms of this [NAME_REDACTED] by [NAME_REDACTED]dlord, its agents, employees, contractors, or other persons for 
whom [NAME_REDACTED]dlord may be responsible.  
 
ARTICLE XI: CASUALTY; EMINENT DOMAIN  
 
 (a) For the purposes of this Article XI, “substantial part” shall be defined as that portion of 
the P remises which if damaged or taken by eminent domain would materially affect the use of the 
[NAME_REDACTED]ses for [ORG_REDACTED].  
 
(b) If the [NAME_REDACTED]ses or any portion thereof shall be destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, 
or taken by any public or quasi -public agency or authority other than [NAME_REDACTED]dlord by right of eminent 
domain, and the casualty/taking unreasonably interferes with the use of the [NAME_REDACTED]ses for the Permitted 
Uses in a manner comparable to such use prior to such casualty/condemnation, this [NAME_REDACTED] se shall 
terminate at the election of either [NAME_REDACTED]dlord or [NAME_REDACTED].  Any such termination shall be effective thirty 
(30) days after the date of notice thereof.     
 
 (c) If any part of the [NAME_REDACTED]ses is damaged by fire or other casualty or is taken by a public 
authority and this [NAME_REDACTED] is not terminated by [NAME_REDACTED]dlord or [NAME_REDACTED] as provided above, [NAME_REDACTED] shall 
proceed with reasonable diligence to repair and restore the [NAME_REDACTED]ses, or what remains thereof in the 
case of a partial taking, to its condition prior to such t aking.  [NAME_REDACTED] acknowledges and agrees that in no 
event shall [NAME_REDACTED]dlord be liable for any injury, harm or any other loss, cost, expense, demand, claim, or 
have any obligation to repair, replace, improve, restore and/or rebuild, any damage of any kind or 
nature whatsoever to the [NAME_REDACTED]ses or any portion thereof caused by an eminent domain taking or by 
fire, flood or other casualty.  
 
 (d) In the event of a taking by eminent domain, [NAME_REDACTED]dlord shall have, and hereby reserves and 
excepts, and [NAME_REDACTED] hereby grants a nd assigns to [NAME_REDACTED]dlord, all rights to recover for damages to the 
[NAME_REDACTED]ses and the leasehold interest hereby created, and to compensation accrued or hereafter to 
accrue by reason of such taking or damage.  [NAME_REDACTED] covenants to deliver such further assignment s and 
assurances thereof as [NAME_REDACTED]dlord may from time to time request, hereby irrevocably designating and 
appointing [NAME_REDACTED]dlord as its attorney -in-fact to execute and deliver in [NAME_REDACTED]'s name and behalf all such 
further assignments thereof.  Nothing contained h erein shall be construed to prevent [NAME_REDACTED] from 

prosecuting in any condemnation proceedings a claim for the value of any of [NAME_REDACTED]'s usual trade 
fixtures installed in the [NAME_REDACTED]ses by [NAME_REDACTED] at [NAME_REDACTED]'s expense and for relocation expenses, provided 
that suc h action shall not affect the amount of compensation otherwise recoverable hereunder by 
[NAME_REDACTED]dlord from the taking authority.  
 
ARTICLE XII: TERMINATION; [ORG_REDACTED]  
 
 In the event that:  
 
 (a)  [NAME_REDACTED] shall default in the payment of Rent or any other sum herein s pecified or shall fail to 
carry and/or maintain the insurance required hereunder and such default shall continue for ten (10) 
days after written notice thereof; or  
 
 (b)  [NAME_REDACTED] shall default in the observance or performance of any other of [NAME_REDACTED] covenants, 
agreements, or obligations hereunder and such default shall not be corrected within thirty (30) days 
after written notice (or any shorter period, if specified herein); or  
 
 (c)  the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the mak ing by [NAME_REDACTED] of any general 
arrangement or assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) [NAME_REDACTED]'s becoming a "debtor" as defined in 
11 U.S.C. §101 or any successor statute thereto (unless, in the case of a petition filed against [NAME_REDACTED], the 
same is dismis sed within 60 days); (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of 
substantially all of [NAME_REDACTED]'s assets located at the [NAME_REDACTED]ses or of [NAME_REDACTED]'s interest in this [NAME_REDACTED], where 
possession is not restored to [NAME_REDACTED] within thirty (30) days ; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other 
judicial seizure of substantially all of [NAME_REDACTED]'s assets located at the [NAME_REDACTED]ses or of [NAME_REDACTED]'s interest in 
this [NAME_REDACTED], where such seizure is not discharged within thirty (30) days; provided, however, in the eve nt 
that any provision of this paragraph (c) is contrary to any applicable law, such provision shall be of no 
force, and not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.  
 
 then [NAME_REDACTED]dlord shall have the right thereafter, while such default continues, to r e-enter and take 
complete possession of the [NAME_REDACTED]ses, to declare [NAME_REDACTED] ended, and remove [NAME_REDACTED] 
effects, without prejudice to any other remedy which may be available to [NAME_REDACTED]dlord. To the extent 
permitted by law, [NAME_REDACTED] shall indemnify [NAME_REDACTED] dlord against all payments which [NAME_REDACTED]dlord may incur by 
reason of such termination during the residue of the Term.  If [NAME_REDACTED] shall default after reasonable 
notice thereof, in the observance or performance of any conditions or covenants on [NAME_REDACTED] part to be 
performed or observed by virtue of any of the provisions of any article of this [NAME_REDACTED], [NAME_REDACTED]dlord, without 
being under any obligation to do so and without thereby waiving such default, may remedy such default 
for the account and at the expense of [NAME_REDACTED]. If [NAME_REDACTED]dlord makes any expenditures or incurs any 
obligations for the payment of money in connection with [NAME_REDACTED] default, including but not limited to, 

reasonable attorneys’ fees in instituting, prosecuting or defending any action or proceeding, such sums  
paid or obligations incurred shall be paid to [NAME_REDACTED]dlord by [NAME_REDACTED] as [ORG_REDACTED].  
 
Without limiting any of [NAME_REDACTED]dlord’s rights and remedies hereunder, and in addition to all other amounts 
[NAME_REDACTED] is otherwise obligated to pay, it is expressly agreed that [NAME_REDACTED]dlord shall be entitled to recover 
from [NAME_REDACTED] all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by [NAME_REDACTED]dlord in 
enforcing this [NAME_REDACTED] from and after [NAME_REDACTED] default.

quiet use and possession of the [NAME_REDACTED]ses without hindrance or interruption on the part  of [NAME_REDACTED]dlord, or

through or under [NAME_REDACTED]dlord, except as herein provided.  
 
13.3.  [NAME_REDACTED]dlord’s Entry.  [NAME_REDACTED]dlord or its agents may, at reasonable times and wit hout interfering with

case of an emergency affecting the [NAME_REDACTED]ses.   
 
13.4.  Yield Up at Termination of [NAME_REDACTED].  [NAME_REDACTED] shall at the expiration or other termination of this 
[NAME_REDACTED] remove all [NAME_REDACTED]'s effects from the [NAME_REDACTED]ses. [NAME_REDACTED] shall deliver the [NAME_REDACTED]ses to [NAME_REDACTED]dlord in the 
condition in which [NAME_REDACTED] is required to maintain the same as set forth in this [NAME_REDACTED], reasonable wear 
and tear excepted.  
 
13.5.  Holding Over.  If [NAME_REDACTED] or anyone claiming under [NAME_REDACTED] shall r emain in possession of the 
[NAME_REDACTED]ses or any part thereof after the expiration of the term hereof, without any agreement in writing 
between [NAME_REDACTED]dlord and [NAME_REDACTED] with respect thereto, the person remaining in possession shall be deemed 
a tenant at sufferance. A fter acceptance by [NAME_REDACTED]dlord of any payments made under this [NAME_REDACTED], the 

person remaining in possession shall be deemed a tenant from month -to-month, subject to the 
provisions of this [NAME_REDACTED] insofar as the same may be made applicable to a tenant from month -to-month, 
which occupancy or use may at any time be terminated by either party by one (1) month’s written 
notice to the other party.  
 
13.6.  Severability.  If any provision of this [NAME_REDACTED] is declared to be illegal, unenforceable, or void, then 
both parties sha ll be relieved of all obligations under that provision provided, however, that the 
remainder of the [NAME_REDACTED] shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

be changed or modified except by a written instrument in accordance with the provisions herein. This 
[NAME_REDACTED] shall be governed by the laws of the [ORG_REDACTED] of Massachusetts. The provisions of those 
laws shall not be deemed waived by any provision of this [NAME_REDACTED].  
 
The failure of either party to seek redress for violation or to insist upon the strict performance of any 
covenant or condition of this [NAME_REDACTED] shall not prevent a subsequent act, which would ha ve originally 
constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of a violation. No provision of this [NAME_REDACTED] shall 
be deemed to have been waived by either party unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party 
to be bound thereby.  
 
No men tion in this [NAME_REDACTED] of any specific right or remedy shall preclude [NAME_REDACTED]dlord or [NAME_REDACTED] from

No official, employee or consultant of [ORG_REDACTED] shall be personally liable to [NAME_REDACTED] or
